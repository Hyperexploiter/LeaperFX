## Pre-deployment Verification ✅

- [x] All mock services replaced with real implementations
- [x] FINTRAC compliance system fully implemented
- [x] Core dashboard components tested (Calculator, Inventory, Analytics)
- [x] Website-dashboard integration tested
- [x] Security headers configured
- [x] Production build optimized
- [x] Error handling implemented throughout
- [x] Real-time WebSocket communication working

## Server Requirements

### Minimum System Requirements
- Node.js 18+ or static web server
- 2GB RAM minimum
- 10GB disk space
- HTTPS certificate (required for production)

### Environment Variables (if using server-side features)
\`\`\`bash
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
# Add any other environment variables here
\`\`\`

## Deployment Steps

1. **Upload files**: Copy the entire \`dist\` folder to your web server
2. **Configure web server**: 
   - Serve static files from the \`dist\` directory
   - Configure HTTPS (required for secure operation)
   - Set up proper caching headers for assets
3. **Database setup**: The system uses IndexedDB (client-side) - no server database required
4. **Security**: Ensure all security headers are properly configured
5. **Testing**: Run the built-in test suites after deployment

## Post-deployment Testing

1. Navigate to the deployment URL
2. Log in to the dashboard
3. Run the "Compliance Test" from the dashboard menu
4. Run the "Integration Test" from the dashboard menu
5. Verify all components are functioning correctly

## Support & Maintenance

- Monitor browser console for any errors
- Regular security updates recommended
- Backup user data stored in browser (IndexedDB)
