# FINTRAC Dashboard Error Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved: "User is not defined" Error

### Problem Description
When accessing the FINTRAC dashboard to assign customers to 10K+ transactions after the fact, the application was crashing with the error:

```
Dashboard Error
The store owner dashboard encountered an error and cannot display properly.

Error Details:
User is not defined

Component Stack Trace:
    at FintracCompliance (http://localhost:5174/src/components/FintracCompliance.tsx:37:43)
```

### Root Cause Analysis
The error was caused by a missing import in the FintracCompliance component. The component was trying to use a `<User />` icon from Lucide React at line 811, but the `User` icon was not included in the import statement at the top of the file.

**Specific Issue:**
- Line 811: `<User className="h-4 w-4 mr-1 inline" />` 
- Missing import: `User` from 'lucide-react'

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. **Fixed Missing Import**
Added the missing `User` icon to the lucide-react imports in `/src/components/FintracCompliance.tsx`:

**Before:**
```typescript
import { 
  Shield, 
  Bell, 
  Lock, 
  UnlockIcon, 
  CheckCircle, 
  Clock, 
  AlertTriangle, 
  Send, 
  FileText,
  Database,
  Download
} from 'lucide-react';
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { 
  Shield, 
  Bell, 
  Lock, 
  UnlockIcon, 
  CheckCircle, 
  Clock, 
  AlertTriangle, 
  Send, 
  FileText,
  Database,
  Download,
  User
} from 'lucide-react';
```

### Testing Results
