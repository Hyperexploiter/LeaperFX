# FINTRAC Compliance Workflow - Enhanced for Professional Use

## Overview

This document outlines the enhanced FINTRAC compliance workflow implemented to handle large transactions (≥$10,000 CAD) with utmost rigor and professionalism. The system now provides multiple touchpoints for customer assignment and compliance management to ensure legal requirements are met.

## Critical Issue Resolved

### Problem
When processing transactions of $10,000 CAD or more, the application would crash due to insufficient error handling in the FintracCompliance component. This created serious legal compliance risks.

### Solution
Implemented comprehensive error handling, validation, and multiple customer assignment workflows to ensure:
- No application crashes during large transaction processing
- Multiple opportunities to assign customers to transactions
- Robust data validation and fallback mechanisms
- Professional compliance management interface

## Enhanced Workflow

### 1. Smart Calculator - Initial Transaction Processing

**When creating a 10K+ transaction:**

1. **Automatic Compliance Detection**: System automatically detects transactions ≥$10,000 CAD
2. **Customer Assignment Options**:
   - Select existing customer from dropdown
   - Add new customer via "+" button
   - Process without customer (can be assigned later)
3. **FINTRAC Compliance Triggers**:
   - Transactions ≥$3,000 CAD: Enhanced record keeping required
   - Transactions ≥$10,000 CAD: LCTR (Large Cash Transaction Report) required
