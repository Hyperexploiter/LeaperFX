## üìã INTEGRATION GUIDE

### How to Use Enhanced Client Registration

```typescript
import EnhancedClientRegistration from '../Clients/EnhancedClientRegistration';

// In your component
const [showRegistration, setShowRegistration] = useState(false);

const handleNewClient = () => {
  setShowRegistration(true);
};

const handleClientComplete = (customer: Customer) => {
  // Customer is now registered with full FINTRAC compliance
  console.log('Client registered:', customer);

  // Link to transaction if needed
  transaction.customerId = customer.id;
};

// In render
{showRegistration && (
  <EnhancedClientRegistration
    onComplete={handleClientComplete}
    onCancel={() => setShowRegistration(false)}
  />
)}
```

### How to Send Receipts

```typescript
import { receiptService } from '../common/services/receiptService';

// After transaction completion
const sendReceipt = async (transactionId: string) => {
  try {
    // Check if customer assigned
    const transaction = await transactionService.getTransaction(transactionId);

    if (transaction.customerId) {
      // Send to registered customer
      await receiptService.sendReceipt(transactionId);
    } else {
      // Prompt for recipient
      const recipient = await promptForRecipient(); // Show modal
      await receiptService.sendReceipt(transactionId, {
        email: recipient.email,
        phone: recipient.phone
      });
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Receipt sending failed:', error);
  }
};
```
