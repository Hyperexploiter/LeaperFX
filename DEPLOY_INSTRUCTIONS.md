# ðŸš€ Final Deployment Instructions

## The Fix
The issue was that Jekyll was trying to process the **root directory** while our React app is in `dashboard/demo/`. 

The new workflow:
- âœ… Only deploys the **built React app** (`dashboard/demo/dist/`)
- âœ… Bypasses all Jekyll processing
- âœ… Creates a clean `gh-pages` branch with only your app

## Deploy Steps

### 1. Push the Fixed Workflow
```bash
git add .github/workflows/deploy.yml
git add DEPLOY_INSTRUCTIONS.md
git commit -m "Fix deployment - isolate React app from Jekyll"
git push origin hyp3r
```

### 2. Repository Settings
**Important**: Go to GitHub repository settings:
1. **Settings** â†’ **Pages**
2. **Source**: `Deploy from a branch`
3. **Branch**: `gh-pages` / `/ (root)`

### 3. Monitor Deployment
- Check **Actions** tab
- Look for "Deploy LeaperFX to GitHub Pages"
- Should complete in 2-3 minutes

## Result
Your app will be live at:
```
https://<your-username>.github.io/Leaper-Fx/
```

Notes:
- Vite base is set to `/Leaper-Fx/` for production to ensure assets resolve correctly on GitHub Pages.
- The workflow deploys only `dashboard/demo/dist` to the `gh-pages` branch and creates a `.nojekyll` file there.
- You don't need to move the workflow into `dashboard/`; keeping it in `.github/workflows/` is correct.
- If your default branch is not `hyp3r`, update the `branches` trigger accordingly.


## SPA fallback for GitHub Pages

To avoid 404 errors when refreshing deep links (client-side routes) on GitHub Pages, a SPA fallback page is included:
- File: dashboard/demo/public/404.html
- Behavior: any unknown route will redirect to the app root at /Leaper-Fx/
- Vite automatically copies files from public/ to dist/ during build, so 404.html will be deployed to gh-pages.

Notes:
- GitHub Pages is case-sensitive. Ensure you use the exact repository path with hyphen: /Leaper-Fx/
- After pushing to hyp3r and the workflow completes, test:
  - https://<your-username>.github.io/Leaper-Fx/
  - Manually navigate to a nested route in the app and refresh; it should redirect to the app without a 404 page.
